# Personal website

This is a repository with the code hosting my public static website, found
at http://www.chadfulton.com.

Since much of the content on the site is Jupyter notebooks showing Python code,
this repository provides a convenient place for maintaining a history of the
notebooks and allowing bug reports when they don't work as expected.
