This notebook collects the full example implementing and estimating (via maximum likelihood, Metropolis-Hastings, and Gibbs Sampling) a simple real business cycle model, from my working paper [Estimating time series models by state space methods in Python: Statsmodels]({{ "/research.html#est-ssm-py" | relative_url }}).
