# Google Colab Python package dependencies

These following commands allow running the example notebooks from the "sm-notebooks-2021" project in Google Colab. They typically must be copied and pasted into the top of the example notebook that you want to run (i.e. it typically does not work to run them in a separate notebook).


```python
!pip install --upgrade "plotly>=4.5"
!pip install --upgrade "statsmodels>=0.12.1"
```
